# ReactJS Meeting Finder

Using only a [Meeting Guide format JSON file](https://github.com/meeting-guide/spec), developers will be able to 
deploy the next-generation interactive frontend found in the [12 Step Meeting List](https://github.com/meeting-guide/12-step-meeting-list)
WordPress plugin.

This should work on any website platform.
